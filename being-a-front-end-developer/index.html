Usually it ends the same way; I generalize my profession as “computer programming” or “I work with computers”. Don’t get it twisted brothers and sisters of the web. I don’t lose sleep thinking about if I should put “developer” or “front-end web developer” on my doctor’s intake forms. I don’t fret over whether my doctor knows the difference either.</p>
<h2 id="So-What-is-a-Front-End-Developer"><a href="#So-What-is-a-Front-End-Developer" class="headerlink" title="So What is a Front-End Developer?"></a>So What is a Front-End Developer?</h2><p>Some folks use web designer, front-end developer, web developer, interaction/interactive developer interchangeably. There are even a few folks that throw user experience in the title somewhere, just to muddy the waters.</p>
<h3 id="We-Need-an-Elevator-Pitch"><a href="#We-Need-an-Elevator-Pitch" class="headerlink" title="We Need an Elevator Pitch"></a>We Need an Elevator Pitch</h3><p>An elevator pitch is the delivery of an idea in the time span of an elevator ride, or approximately thirty seconds to two minutes.</p>
<p><em>Is it possible to sum up my chosen profession in thirty seconds? I believe so.</em></p>
<p>I am a front-end web developer. I am responsible for the parts of web that you can see. I make beautiful, functional, and useful websites and applications. I strive for simple, efficient, and concise quality in the code I write.</p>
<h2 id="But-the-Devil-is-in-the-Details"><a href="#But-the-Devil-is-in-the-Details" class="headerlink" title="But the Devil is in the Details"></a>But the Devil is in the Details</h2><p>Most likely I’m “preaching to the converted”. You’re likely a developer or designer of some sort. I know what you’re thinking, so what’s the laundry list of things a front-end developer takes care of?</p>
<h3 id="Presentation"><a href="#Presentation" class="headerlink" title="Presentation"></a>Presentation</h3><p>Knowledge of semantic markup is a must. HTML rules everything around me. CSS has come a long way in recent years, the amount of things accomplished with it are amazing. Some folks think being a front-end developer stops right here.</p>
<h3 id="Interaction"><a href="#Interaction" class="headerlink" title="Interaction"></a>Interaction</h3><p>Knowledge of javascript is a must as well. In some settings, knowing only a bit of jquery will suffice. The more javascript a front-end developer knows the better.</p>
<h3 id="Accessibility"><a href="#Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="Accessibility"></a>Accessibility</h3><p>All front-end developers should be concerned with accessibility. Depending on a site’s user base, a large part could have a disability that makes normal web browsing difficult. Making sure the sites and apps we build are available across the most devices, to the most people, isn’t just good business sense. It’s common sense.</p>
<h3 id="Usability"><a href="#Usability" class="headerlink" title="Usability"></a>Usability</h3><p>This goes along with accessibility, keeping tabs on usability should be a priority for us as well. Making sure the site and apps feel good to a end user. Having well thought out feature sets. Keeping the end user’s goals and our (or the client’s) business goals in mind.</p>
<h3 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h3><p>We need to make sure these sites and apps load wicked fast. Making and maintaining performance budgets. Being frugal with http requests and code best practices to ensure load times are minimal.</p>
<p>I could rant on longer, but I want to work on my elevator pitch.</p>

It may have been the desire to be faster. Maybe it was the constant stream of tweets and blog posts about VIM. Could programming be quicker and simpler with VIM? I was stepping out on my editor (Sublime Text 2) and looking at the greener VIM grass.</p></div></a><a href="/principles-of-modern-web/" class="next"><div class="article__next"><h6 class="article__title">Principles of the Modern Web</h6><p>Everything I think design and development should be.</p></div></a></div><div class="footer-sections"><div class="colophon"> <a href="/colophon">Colophon</a></div><div class="colophon"><small>Built with ♥ in Tennessee</small></div><div class="social"> <a href="http://twitter.com/bowshears">Twitter</a> /  <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/jeffboshers">Linkedin</a> /  <a href="http://dribbble.com/boundbystars">Dribbble</a></div></div></footer><div class="info-modal modal"><div class="modal__close">⌃</div><div class="modal__header"><canvas id="canvas" width="200" height="200" class="mypic"></canvas></div><div class="modal__body"><div class="grid"><section class="half"><h5 class="modal__title">Show & Tell</h5><p>I am designer and developer. Most folks call me LunchBox, or LB. I'm a digital creator and maker. I guess if you had to put a label on it, I'm a front end developer. I love coming up with ideas and building them. From time to time I help others flesh out their ideas.</p><p>I'm old school. I coded my first site in the early oughts. Tables were still cool. CSS was just a garden. Phones still flipped. Get off my lawn.</p><p>Before making the plunge to full-time code monkey, I worked normal everyday jobs. I've worked in a Chinese restaurant and then an adult bookstore, and those were just some of the highlights. I freelanced for a while, it was okay.</p></section><div class="half"> <section><h5 class="modal__title">Publications</h5><ul><li>Six Revisions - <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/project-management/the-crowdsourcing-quagmire/">The Crowdsourcing Quagmire</a></li><li>One Xtra Pixel - <a href="http://www.onextrapixel.com/2010/05/25/tactics-on-selling-the-hard-sell-and-the-soft-sell/">Tactics on Selling</a></li></ul></section><section><h5 class="modal__title">Speaking</h5><ul><li>Nodevember 2014 - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JJGtTzIv7k">Use a Task Runner Already!</a></li></ul></section></div></div><div class="grid"> <section id="languages" class="third"></section><section id="albums" class="third"></section><section id="books" class="third"></section></div></div></div><script src="/js/varg.js"></script></body></html>
