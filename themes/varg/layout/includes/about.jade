        p I am designer and developer. Most folks call me LunchBox, or LB. I'm a digital creator and maker. I guess if you had to put a label on it, I'm a front end developer. I love coming up with ideas and building them. From time to time I help others flesh out their ideas.
        p I'm old school. I coded my first site in the early oughts. Tables were still cool. CSS was just a garden. Phones still flipped. Get off my lawn.
        p Before making the plunge to full-time code monkey, I worked normal everyday jobs. I've worked in a Chinese restaurant and then an adult bookstore, and those were just some of the highlights. I freelanced for a while, it was okay.
