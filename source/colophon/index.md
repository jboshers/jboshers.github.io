This site is built upon good bones. The framework is [Hexo](http://hexo.io). Everything is built in HTML, CSS, Javascript. More specifically PostCSS, HTML5, and React. Coding insights are powered by [Wakatime](http://wakatime.com). Musical insights are enabled by the powerful combo of [lastfm](http://last.fm)/[Spotify](http://spotify.com). My reading list is powered by [GoodReads](http://goodreads.com).

Fonts included in this site are Young Serif, Work Sans, and Brandon Grotesque.
