## The Modern Web is _Simple_.
In design or in code, simplicity trumps all. What is clever and novel today is tomorrow's technical debt.

## The Modern Web is _Fast_.
The modern web thrives on speed. Design faster. Code faster. Ship faster. Fail faster.

## The Modern Web is _Familiar_.
Patterns made the modern web. Reuse code and design elements. Stop reinventing the wheel.

## The Modern Web is _Accessible_.
The modern web is for everyone; regardless of their abilities. Everyone should be able to find your cat website.

## The Modern Web is _Agnostic_.
The modern web is like water, it will fit into any container you put it in. Plan for unimagined devices and uses by remaining adaptable and responsive.

## The Modern Web is _Testable_.
Throwing shit at the walls to see what sticks; means that no matter what your walls are still covered in shit. Use the data available to you to design and develop, then test your data again. _Wash.Rinse.Repeat._

## The Modern Web is _Iterative_.
Design is never finished. The modern web is a moving, evolving platform.
_Measure.Design.Deploy.Refine._
